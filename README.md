# Let's Go Tic-Tac-Toe

[Play Tic Tac Toe Here](https://infinite-taiga-34074.herokuapp.com/)

### An interactive tic tac toe game that allows two players to play tic tac toe against one another and stores the users in a database with their wins and losses.  A leaderboard of the top five winners is displayed on the front page.  When a third player logs in, the player gets automatically added to the queue of waiting players and immediately enters the game once a current player exits the game.  

## Instructions:
* Create a new username or log in as an exiting user.
* Wait for another player to join the game and start playing.
* Any number of players beyond 2 get added to a queue of players.
* Upon losing, you will get knocked out to the end of the queue (if there are other players waiting). 
* The winner's count gets updated in the database and begins playing the next person waiting in the queue.

## Uses:
* Bootstrap
* Handlebars
* Express
* MySQL 
* Sequelize
* Chart.js
* Socket.io
